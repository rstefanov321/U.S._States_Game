# U.S._States_Game
A game that asks the user to enter a US State and if correct, its name appears on a map. Once all states are guessed correctly or the user decides to leave, the game ends. 

If there are some states that have not been guessed, a CSV file is created to show the missing states that the player should learn. The idea of the game is to show the use of writing to files and creating Dataframes using Pandas.
